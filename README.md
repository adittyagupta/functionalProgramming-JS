# What is Functional Programming
Functional programming is a programming paradigm - that treats computations as the evaluation of **mathematical functions** and **avoids changing-state and mutable data**.

Functional programming in a nutshell comprises of:
- First class functions
- Pure functions
- No side effects
- Immutable data
- Statelessness
- Lazy evaluation
